# dotfiles


### Automagically backup dotfiles.

update.sh

all dotfiles added in file update.sh to variable `config_files` are automagically copied to directory `homedir` unless... you edit it

```markdown
usage:
```
* bash update.sh

now you can upload your carefully choosen config files to github

they are safe now
